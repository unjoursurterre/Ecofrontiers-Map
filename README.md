# Ecofrontiers Map

## General

The Ecofrontiers Map is a map interface enabling the discovery of tokenized natural capital assets throughout the globe.

The Map will be developed following three phases:

1. Displaying of all tokenized natural capital assets.
2. Projects aiming to tokenize natural capital can list their projects on the Map to request funding. 
3. Enabling the buying of tokenized natural capital assets directly on the Map.

## Target Audience

The target audiences of the Ecofrontiers Map are:

- Projects tokenizing natural capital need a clear and intuitive platform to sell their assets.
- Organizations, governments & individuals willing to buy tokenized natural capital need a marketplace enabling asset discovery.
- Environmental projects aiming to tokenize natural capital looking for funding need a platform to advertise their project.
- Environmental & economics researchers, writers, academics & scholars need information about the state of the tokenized natural capital market.
